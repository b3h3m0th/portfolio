Athenic UI is a beautiful and easy to use [React](https://react.dev/) component library.
I initially developed the library for a startup idea of a friend and published it later on to NPM.
As of 2023 the package had been downloaded about 20.000 times.

My goal was to create an opinionated modular system that allows you to create nice user interfaces without much effort.

The library includs about 30 handmade React components such as buttons, modals, cards, inputs, menus, drawers, popups, loaders and much more without any third party styling packages.
