## About Obsidian

Obsidian is a personal knowledge base and note-taking software application that operates on Markdown files. It allows users to make internal links for notes and then to visualize the connections as a graph. It is designed to help users organize and structure their thoughts and knowledge in a flexible, non-linear way. ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsidian_(software)))

## Black Theme

Iâ€™ve been using the [Just Black](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nur.just-black) theme in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for many years and still love it. When I started working with Obsidian extensively, I noticed there wasn't a similar theme available, so I decided to create one myself. I published it as a community theme for public use.
