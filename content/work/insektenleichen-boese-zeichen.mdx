I was honored to work on a multimedia reading project of author, playwriter and former Vorarlberg Cultural Office Head [Werner Grabher](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Grabher) and film director, actor, singer and former State Secretary [Franz Morak](https://www.franzmorak.at/).
Both are highly respected personalities in the Austrian cultural scene.

Werner Grabher commissioned me to design the visuals of his presentation.
The event itself took place at the [Freudenhaus](https://freudenhaus.or.at/) in Lustenau, Austria.
