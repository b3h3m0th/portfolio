## Overview

*Bregenz bewegt* is an initiative of the city [Bregenz](https://bregenz.gv.at) in Austria to promote sport and exercise, especially among young people.
Some good friends and I developed a mobile application for Bregenz as our practical school diploma theisis.

The application shows public outdoor locations to exercise and offers instruction videos.
Furthermore, a playful competitive aspect was added: Users are awarded points called *B-Bucks* for exercising.
A user can earn B-Bucks by scanning a provided QR-code on a training location in the city and later redeem real world prices such as coupons or special offers at local stores.
The concept is heavily inspired by [Pok√©mon Go](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%c3%a9mon_Go).

The project strechted over almost a year. During that time all must-have requirements could be delivered and many more unplanned features were added.
Here are some cool features worth mentioning:
- Friend system: users can add friends and directly compare profiles.
- Chats: users can connect with other people and arrange a meet to exercise together.
- Notifications: users receive notifications and latest news.
- Preferences: users can customize their profile, set their preferred exercise difficulty, in-app theme and much more.

## Technical

Technologies used:

- Frontend: [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), [React](https://react.dev), [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com)
- Backend: [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com), [Prisma](https://prisma.io), [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
- Other libraries & services: [Nx](https://nx.dev), [JWT](https://jwt.io/), [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/)

The entire project is public on Github and quite well documented ([source code](https://github.com/bregenz-bewegt/bregenz-bewegt)).

We built Bregenz bewegt as a hybrid application with [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) and [React](https://react.dev/) that can be run in any browser and as a native mobile application on Android and IOS devices.
The backend is based on [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/) and [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/). It was my first time using Nest.js and Prisma in a real project and I cannot describe how much I loved it!
We chose a classic MySql database for persisting data yet it didn't really matter anyway due to our Prisma *code first* approach.
