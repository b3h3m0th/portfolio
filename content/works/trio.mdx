*TRIO - Alle guten Dinge sind drei* was a school event that took place in the [Altes Hallenbad Feldkirch](https://www.altes-hallenbad.at/), Austria, in 2022.

I was responsible for the entire visual design such as posters and flyers.
Additionally, I created a small website based on the poster ([Source code](https://github.com/b3h3m0th/trio_website)).
