## About #klartext

*#klartext* is the largest and most successful panel discussion in the whole of Austria. Every year, top politicians are invited to discuss the current political situation in Austria and beyond. In 2024 the european parliament election was the main topic. 

In order to close the gap that still exists in the area of political education in Austrian schools, the most successful discussion format is being relaunched. This will give young people and first-time voters (preferably pupils aged between 16 and 20) an informative and equally exciting platform for their decision-making.

## My Work

I was responsible for developing a corporate design and branding. Furthermore, I designed all visuals such as flyers, posters, wristbands, etc.
