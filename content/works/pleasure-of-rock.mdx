The *Pleasure Of Rock* Festival has been a fixture on the West Austrian rock and metal scene for many years.
Developed a few years ago by young volunteers from the Lustenau Open Youth Work, it is now known far beyond the borders of Vorarlberg, with international stars such as Neara, Walls Of Jericho, War From A Harlot's Mouth, Black Dahlia Murder and Turbobier having played on the *Pleasure Of Rock* stage at various locations in Lustenau in recent years.
In 2024, it will take place for the second time in the magnificent [Freudenhaus](https://freudenhaus.or.at/) location in Lustenau as a cooperation between the open youth work organizations in Lustenau and Dornbirn, together with the Caravan association.
Four selected bands from the region provided the right atmosphere at Pleasure of Rock: Sektor 7, StageFright, Hjewy Tzjepr and TV Nights. ([Freudenhaus](https://freudenhaus.or.at/programm/2024/pleasure-of-rock/))
