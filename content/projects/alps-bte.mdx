In early 2020 a YouTuber named [PippenFTS](https://www.youtube.com/@PippenFTS) uploaded a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bW3ab8YAk) of a ridiculous idea: He wondered if it was possible to build the entire earth in Minecraft in a 1:1 scale.
With the help of new mods like [Terra 1:1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/terra-1-to-1-minecraft-world-project) Minecraft worlds could be generated according to Google Maps data, however without buildings.
Players all over the world gathered together and starting building their own house, their neighboor's house or maybe even their entire city.

To coordinate the project a community called [Minecraft Build The Earth](https://buildtheearth.net/) that communicated over [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fXwTQVtt6c) was founded and split into several build teams.
My friends and I founded a team for Austria. As the project got larger we merged with the swiss team and named us *Alps BTE*.
We were responsible for coordinating Switzerland, Liechtenstein and Austria. As of 2023 the [Alps BTE Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/vgkspay) has more than 4000 members contributing to building our planet.

Since I had never been a very gifted Minecraft builder, I took the role of the developer and built our website [alps-bte.com](https://alps-bte.com).
