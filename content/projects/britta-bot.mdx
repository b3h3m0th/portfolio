In early 2020, when the corona pandamic first hit Austria, I used to spend a lot of time with my friends on [Discord](https://discord.com/).
At that time there was a huge hype about discord bots, especially about bots that were able to join your voice channel and play music.
Quickly, people noticed that you could monetize bots by offering "premium" features, you had to pay for.
Many music bots started to limited their playtime, streaming platform support, song skips... Essentially everything that made users grab their credit card.

So, I decided to build a music bot named "Britta" myself, that offered the same features like the big players for free for everybody forever.

Britta was developed with:

- [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). An amazing Node.js library that interacts with the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference).
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Used to store required guild and user data.
- [Erela.js](https://github.com/erelajs). A rich audio processing library based on [Lavalink](https://lavalink.dev/).
