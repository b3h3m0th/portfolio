## About #klartext

*#klartext* is the largest and most successful panel discussion in the whole of Austria. Every year, top politicians are invited to discuss the current political situation in Austria and beyond.
In 2024 the european parliament election was the main topic.  

I was responsible for developing a corporate design and branding.

Furthermore, I designed all visuals such as flyers, posters, wristbands, etc.
